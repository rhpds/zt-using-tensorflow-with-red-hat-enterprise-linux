In this step, you will set up a Jupyter Notebook to run your code.
First, ensure that your Conda environment is activated. When activated,
your command prompt will look like this:

If it is inactive, you can activate it with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
conda activate tf
----

Next, install the necessary components to run the Jupyter Notebook and
perform data visualization

[source,bash]
----
pip install notebook matplotlib
----

Finally, start the Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
nohup conda run -n tf jupyter notebook --ip=* --no-browser --allow-root -NotebookApp.password='redhat' -NotebookApp.token='redhat' --notebook-dir="/root/tensorflow" </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &
----

The output will look like this, but the exact numbers may vary:
