First, create a Conda environment for TensorFlow:

[source,bash]
----
conda create --name tf python=3.9 -y
----

Then, activate the Conda environment using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
conda activate tf
----

Your Conda environment status is shown in the command line within
parentheses like this:

Next, we need to ensure that Pip, Pythonâ€™s package manager, is up to
date. To do this, we can run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
pip install --upgrade pip
----

Finally, we can install TensorFlow from pip. We will use the CPU-only
build of TensorFlow because we are not using a GPU for ML on this
system.

[source,bash]
----
pip install tensorflow-cpu
----

To verify that Tensorflow is running properly on the CPU, run the
following command, which will execute a simple Python test program:

[source,bash]
----
python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])))" 2>/dev/null
----

The output should look like this. The numbers may differ, but it should
have this format:
