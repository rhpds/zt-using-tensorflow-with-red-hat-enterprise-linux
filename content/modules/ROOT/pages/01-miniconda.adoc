The first step to configure TensorFlow is to install Miniconda, which
allows us to set up programming environments. Before we can install it,
we must add its repository to the package manager. To enable this, we
need to add EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux). EPEL is a series
of community-derived packages designed to increase the flexibility of
working with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

[source,bash]
----
subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-$(arch)-rpms
dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm -y
----

You are now ready to install Miniconda. To install, run the following
commands:

[source,bash]
----
dnf install conda -y #installs Miniconda
conda init bash #configures Conda to our shell
exec $SHELL #restarts the shell to finish installation of Miniconda
----

Finally, run the following command to verify the installation of Conda:

[source,bash]
----
conda -V
----

It will print out the version of Conda that is installed to confirm that
the installation of Conda is complete.
